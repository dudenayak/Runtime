#  Virtual Hospital (AR)

Our website provides users with access to all they require to look after themselves and their families. The state of hospital beds, equipment used, and other medical and surgical tools can all be viewed by users. They can arrange medical appointments, receive prescriptions through chatbot, and access a distinct dashboard for each user after signing up, which displays their details and appointments. A distinct part where users can contact and send messages at any time.
